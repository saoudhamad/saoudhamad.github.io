      <p>What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man. No man at all. A crippled little rata. What a reputation to leave behind. Is that how you want to be remembered? Last chance to look at me, Hector. Can I help you sir? What can I do for you? I'm... sorry, I'm not following. I... think that you're confusing me for someone else. Sir, if you have a complaint, I suggest you submit it through our email system. I will be happy to refer you to our website. </p>
      <p>I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late and he was high. He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement. I can't work with someone with poor judgement. I've been told, it's excellent. That is not the only factor. I have to ask... why? Why him? How much product do you have on hand? I have your numbers. You can never trust a drug addict. </p>
